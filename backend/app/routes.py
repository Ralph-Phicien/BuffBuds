This file contains the primary routes/endpoints for the BuffBuds application,
handling core features such as workouts, exercises, user feeds, and other
non-authentication related functionalities.

HTTP Methods for Flask Routes:

|---------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| GET     | Retrieve or display data         | Show a webpage or fetch info       |
| POST    | Submit or create data            | Handle form submissions            |

| DELETE  | Remove data                     | Delete a resource                  |

Notes:
- If 'methods' is not specified, Flask defaults to ['GET'].
- Specify 'methods' when your route needs to handle POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- When using address bar in browser for testing the route, GET is used
- http://127.0.0.1:5000/ + route (/api/ for main routes)
