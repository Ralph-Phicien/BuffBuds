"""
Logging Levels and Activation

The logging module supports multiple severity levels, which control
the importance of the logged messages. The active logging level acts
as a threshold: only messages at that level or higher are output.

Levels (from lowest to highest severity):

DEBUG (10)    - Detailed diagnostic information for developers.
INFO (20)     - General informational messages about app operation.
WARNING (30)  - Indications of potential issues or important events.
ERROR (40)    - Errors that prevent normal program execution.
CRITICAL (50) - Severe errors causing program failure.

Activation:

- The logger's level is set via configuration (e.g., logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO))
- Messages with severity **equal or higher** than the configured level are emitted.
- Messages below the set level are ignored.
- For example, if level=INFO, DEBUG messages will not be shown, but INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL will.
